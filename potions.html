        <p><h5>I personally think that Harry Potter is a really good fantasy and book to start with. The first thing is that Harry, Hermione and Ron(The Golden Trio) were in wrong houses. Harry should be in Slytherine because of his Parseltongue; Hermione could be in Ravenclaw because she is a girl; Ron could be in Hufflepuff. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Pettigrew should have been killed but the story takes a turn. The very emotional part was dying of Weasley and the other Aurors. The only thing I hated was the marriage of Ron and Hermione.</h5></p>
